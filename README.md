# Atrium

Understanding-first multiplayer conversation. Three synchronized surfaces —
**Conversation** (what people are saying), **Current state** (what the group now
understands and is committed to), **Needs you** (what specifically requires this
person) — over a semantic core that turns messages into typed, correctable,
provenance-carrying state.

The thesis being tested, from `init.md`: after being absent for several hours,
can a participant understand the situation, the changes, the open questions and
their own responsibilities substantially faster than in Slack?

## Boot it

Requires Node 22.12+, pnpm 10, and Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # defaults work as-is
pnpm install
pnpm infra:up             # postgres:16 + minio, via docker compose
pnpm db:migrate           # apply the drizzle migrations
pnpm dev                  # web on :3000, server on :4000
```

`pnpm dev` builds `packages/*` once, then runs both apps in watch mode.

Everything in containers instead:

```bash
docker compose up --build   # postgres, minio, migrate, server, app
```

Same compose file locally and on the VPS (issue #18) — only `.env` differs.

## Layout

```
apps/web        Next.js 16 App Router, React 19. The three-region shell.
apps/server     Node 22. ws WebSocket server + pg-boss workers. One process.
packages/core   The Semantic Core. Pure TypeScript, zero I/O.
packages/db     Drizzle schema, migrations, postgres-js client.
packages/ingest Replay ingest. Conversations in, canonical JSONL out.
corpora/        Committed replay corpora (see below).
design/         Design tokens (light default, dark via `html.atr-dark`).
```

The dependency arrow only ever points one way: `web`/`server` → `db` → `core`.
`packages/core` imports nothing from `node:*`, no driver, no clock — that purity
is what makes interpretation replayable and unit-testable in isolation.

### The semantic model

Five first-class accepted object types share one table with a `type`
discriminator and a typed jsonb payload: **decision**, **commitment**,
**open_question**, **claim**, **objective**. Supersession, dependency, blocking,
answering and evidence are typed edges in `relations`, not objects. Proposals
are pre-acceptance staging and never render as facts. Corrections are events, so
nothing is ever erased. Attention items are a recomputable projection and every
one of them must say why it needs *this* person. (Issue #3.)

`reduce(events) → state` in `packages/core` is deterministic and total: events
are canonically ordered by `(at, id)`, a malformed event is recorded in
`state.issues` rather than thrown, and the same log always serializes
byte-identically.

### Replay ingest

`packages/ingest` turns a real conversation into the canonical replay format
(issue #2) — JSONL, one message per line:

```json
{"id":"github:vercel/next.js#11552/c2632","author":"timneutkens","ts":"2020-04-01T15:43:13.000Z","text":"Only if your code changes. In cases of data it can just be re-rendered.","reply_to":"github:vercel/next.js#11552/c2631"}
```

`{id, author, ts, text, reply_to?, attachments?[]}` — small on purpose, so a
Slack or Discord export adapter is a field rename and pasted markdown converts
with a tiny parser. Files in, files out: no database, no interpretation, no UI.

```bash
pnpm ingest list                      # registered sources
pnpm ingest nextjs-isr                # → corpora/nextjs-isr.jsonl
pnpm ingest all                       # every registered source
pnpm ingest nextjs-isr --check        # fail if a refetch would change the file
pnpm ingest markdown notes.md         # pasted transcript → JSONL on stdout
pnpm ingest validate                  # re-validate the committed corpora
```

Three corpora are committed:

| File | Source | Role | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `corpora/nextjs-isr.jsonl` | Next.js discussion #11552, *RFC: Incremental Static Regeneration* | **demo** | 454 messages, 368 reply edges, 184 participants. A two-year RFC-to-shipped-feature argument with real threading — which is what the replay UI has to render. |
| `corpora/ts9998.jsonl` | TypeScript #9998, *Trade-offs in Control Flow Analysis* | sample | A decade-long design argument, and the only corpus on the REST path. Flat: GitHub *issues* carry no threading, so it has zero reply edges — which is why it is no longer the demo. |
| `corpora/holdout-nextjs-rfc.jsonl` | Next.js discussion #37136, *RFC: Layouts* | eval holdout | Reserved for the interpretation-quality golden set, so prompts are never tuned on the corpus they are scored against. Never demoed. |

A rerun is byte-identical. Ids are derived from the source, messages are sorted
by `(ts, id)`, keys are written in a fixed order, message bodies are stored
verbatim, and nothing records when the fetch happened — so `pnpm ingest all`
twice leaves `git diff` empty and any real change to the upstream thread shows
up as a readable diff.

**Bodies are verbatim.** No NFC composition, no line-ending rewriting, no
trailing-whitespace strip — two trailing spaces are a Markdown hard break, and
stripping them would silently reflow what someone wrote. Determinism comes from
stable source bytes plus canonical *serialisation*, not from normalising the
text; JSON escaping carries CR, LF, tabs and combining marks through unchanged.

**A partial corpus is unwritable.** A truncated fetch is the dangerous failure
because its output looks perfect — schema-clean, canonically ordered, stable
across reruns, and missing half the conversation. So the fetchers throw rather
than return short: on a stalled cursor (`hasNextPage` with no `endCursor`), on
the page-count guard being hit with pages outstanding, on the same item arriving
twice, and on the fetched count disagreeing with the API's own `totalCount`
(GraphQL) or `comments` count (REST). The failure paths are covered by
transport-mock tests, not just by the committed corpora.

**A corpus is a snapshot at fetch time — by design.** It records the thread as
the API described it during that one run, reconciled against the API's own
counts so it is a coherent single moment rather than a smear across a mid-run
edit. Edits, deletions and new messages *after* that run are out of scope:
replay is about what was said, and a refetch is how you move the snapshot
forward. When upstream really has changed, the rerun's `git diff` is the record
of what changed — which is the point of committing the corpora at all. There is
no attempt to reconcile a stored corpus against later upstream history, and
`--check` deliberately reports drift as a failure rather than absorbing it.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Build packages, then web + server in watch mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build packages, then both apps |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest across `packages/*` |
| `pnpm ingest <source>` | Fetch a conversation into `corpora/` (see Replay ingest) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright smoke test in `apps/web` |
| `pnpm lint` | Biome lint + format check |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Biome with safe fixes applied |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` in every workspace |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generate a migration from the Drizzle schema |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `pnpm infra:up` / `infra:down` | Postgres + MinIO only |

Playwright needs its browser once: `pnpm --filter @atrium/web exec playwright
install chromium`. Without it the smoke test skips with a reason instead of
failing — a red e2e run should mean "the app is broken", never "no browser
here".

## Notes for the next change

- `design/tokens.css` is a placeholder transcribed from the settled Atrium token
  system recorded in `plans/research-live-call-design-system/`. When the
  `design/tokens` branch lands, replace the file wholesale; the app reads only
  the variables and hardcodes no colour.
- `interpret-message` is registered as a no-op worker. Its idempotency contract
  is already in place: dedup key `${messageId}:${interpretationVersion}` with an
  explicit singleton window, backed by the `(message_id, interpretation_version)`
  unique constraint on `interpretations` (issue #16).
- The WebSocket protocol is a heartbeat + echo placeholder. The real command and
  event contract slots into `handleFrame` without the transport changing.
- Adapter seams (`ConversationSource`, `ExecutionProvider`) are type-only ports
  in `packages/core/src/ports.ts`. No integration ships in v1; the door stays
  open.
