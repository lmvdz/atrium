# Atrium

Understanding-first multiplayer conversation. Three synchronized surfaces —
**Conversation** (what people are saying), **Current state** (what the group now
understands and is committed to), **Needs you** (what specifically requires this
person) — over a semantic core that turns messages into typed, correctable,
provenance-carrying state.

The thesis being tested, from `init.md`: after being absent for several hours,
can a participant understand the situation, the changes, the open questions and
their own responsibilities substantially faster than in Slack?

## Boot it

Requires Node 22.12+, pnpm 10, and Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # required first — compose has no default secrets
pnpm install
pnpm infra:up             # postgres:16 + minio, via docker compose
pnpm db:migrate           # apply the drizzle migrations
pnpm dev                  # web on :3000, server on :4000
```

`pnpm dev` builds `packages/*` once, then runs both apps in watch mode.

Everything in containers instead:

```bash
docker compose up --build   # postgres, minio, migrate, server, app
```

Same compose file locally and on the VPS (issue #18) — only `.env` differs.

### The credentials in this repo are development-only

`.env.example` ships postgres `atrium:atrium` and MinIO
`atrium:atrium-dev-secret`. **They are development credentials, published in a
public repository.** They exist so a laptop boots with no setup, and for nothing
else. Never run this stack on a public VPS with those values.

Three things enforce that rather than merely asking:

- The three secrets in `docker-compose.yml` — `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
  `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — are each `${VAR:?...}` with **no
  default**. Compose refuses to start when one is unset instead of reusing a
  known password. That is why `cp .env.example .env` is the first step above.
  The non-secret settings (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `S3_BUCKET`,
  `S3_REGION`, ports, log level) do keep defaults.
- `apps/server/src/env.ts` applies its dev fallback for `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` **only** when `NODE_ENV` is explicitly `development`.
  An **unset `NODE_ENV` is treated as production** — "nobody said" on a bare
  host is a host on the internet — so `docker run atrium-server` with no
  environment at all fails at boot with a named error rather than reaching for
  a public secret. `pnpm dev` sets `NODE_ENV=development` itself; that is the
  opt-in.
- Every value is trimmed before it is validated, so a secret pasted with the
  newline that came with it still authenticates, and a variable set to nothing
  but whitespace fails as empty instead of passing a length check.

Before exposing anything: set real values in `.env` (or the deployment's own
secret store), and do not publish 5432 / 9000 / 9001 at all unless you mean to.
Only 3000 and 4000 need to face the internet.

## Layout

```
apps/web        Next.js 16 App Router, React 19. The three-region shell.
apps/server     Node 22. ws WebSocket server + pg-boss workers. One process.
packages/core   The Semantic Core. Pure TypeScript, zero I/O.
packages/db     Drizzle schema, migrations, postgres-js client.
design/         Design tokens (light default, dark via `html.atr-dark`).
```

The dependency arrow only ever points one way: `web`/`server` → `db` → `core`.
`packages/core` imports nothing from `node:*`, no driver, no clock — that purity
is what makes interpretation replayable and unit-testable in isolation.

### The semantic model

Five first-class accepted object types share one table with a `type`
discriminator and a typed jsonb payload: **decision**, **commitment**,
**open_question**, **claim**, **objective**. Supersession, dependency, blocking,
answering and evidence are typed edges in `relations`, not objects. Proposals
are pre-acceptance staging and never render as facts. Corrections are events, so
nothing is ever erased. Attention items are a recomputable projection and every
one of them must say why it needs *this* person. (Issue #3.)

`reduce(events) → state` in `packages/core` is deterministic and total: events
are canonically ordered by `(at, id)`, a malformed event is recorded in
`state.issues` rather than thrown, and the same log always serializes
byte-identically.

The reducer is also where the trust boundary is enforced, not merely described.
A recorded proposal is always `proposed` — an interpreter cannot hand itself an
`accepted` one, and the record is the only place a proposal's status lives, so
acceptance cannot leave a stale copy behind. An acceptance that cites a proposal
must cite one that exists, is still open, has not already been spent on another
object, and matches the object's type. An acceptance that cites *no* proposal
must come from a human actor: that is the answer-binding path, where a person
writes a decision directly. A model has exactly one route to a fact — propose
it, and have a human accept the proposal.

### Consumed, or rejected

Live folding is a command, not a fold. `appendEvent(state, event)` returns a
typed outcome:

- **applied** — consumed and applied.
- **applied with issue** — consumed, and a business problem was recorded in
  `state.issues` (a coerced proposal, an amendment to an object that does not
  exist, a relation that fails its type signature). It happened, in order; a
  replay of the log reproduces it exactly.
- **rejected** — *not* consumed. The event sorts before `state.cursor` in the
  canonical `(at, id)` order, or its id was already applied. Rejection leaves
  nothing behind: no issue, no cursor movement, no `appliedEventIds` entry. The
  state handed back is the state handed in, the same object.

So consumption only ever moves forward, and the consumed sequence is in
canonical order by construction. For any log `L` of consumed events, folding
`L` one event at a time in arrival order and replaying `L` in one `reduce` call
produce byte-identical states — `issues` and `appliedEventIds` included. That
is the entire live≡replay claim, and it is checked property-style over
generated logs with same-timestamp ties, two rooms, redeliveries and a mix of
all three outcomes (`packages/core/test/replay.test.ts`).

The other half of the invariant is the ledger's, and it is recorded on
[#22](https://github.com/lmvdz/atrium/issues/22): the durable log must contain
only events accepted in canonical order, because an out-of-order event is
rejected at the command layer and never persisted. Rejected events enter
neither state nor log, so the two sides are folding the same sequence rather
than being reconciled after the fact.

`CoreState.watermarks` still records each room's last consumed position — that
is what `core_events.room_seq` will map onto — but the gate is the global
`cursor`, because `issues`, `corrections` and `appliedEventIds` are global
ordered lists and a per-room gate would let two rooms interleave them one way
live and another way on replay.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Build packages, then web + server in watch mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build packages, then both apps |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest across `packages/*` |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright smoke test in `apps/web` |
| `pnpm lint` | Biome lint + format check |
| `pnpm lint:fix` | Biome with safe fixes applied |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` in every workspace |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generate a migration from the Drizzle schema |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `pnpm infra:up` / `infra:down` | Postgres + MinIO only |

Playwright needs its browser once: `pnpm --filter @atrium/web exec playwright
install chromium`. Without it the smoke test skips with a reason instead of
failing — a red e2e run should mean "the app is broken", never "no browser
here".

## Notes for the next change

- `design/tokens.css` is a placeholder transcribed from the settled Atrium token
  system recorded in `plans/research-live-call-design-system/`. When the
  `design/tokens` branch lands, replace the file wholesale; the app reads only
  the variables and hardcodes no colour.
- `interpret-message` is registered as a no-op worker. Its idempotency contract
  is already in place: dedup key `${messageId}:${interpretationVersion}` with an
  explicit singleton window, backed by the `(message_id, interpretation_version)`
  unique constraint on `interpretations` (issue #16).
- The WebSocket protocol is a heartbeat + echo placeholder. The real command and
  event contract slots into `handleFrame` without the transport changing.
- Adapter seams (`ConversationSource`, `ExecutionProvider`) are type-only ports
  in `packages/core/src/ports.ts`. No integration ships in v1; the door stays
  open.
